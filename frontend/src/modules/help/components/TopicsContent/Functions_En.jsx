      <p className="regular text-justify">
        You can search for so-called Extended Dataset Profiles (EDP) on daseen.
        An EDP is a standardized metadata description of a data set (asset)
        offered by a data provider/publisher directly or via a data portal or
        data space (data source). An asset consists of one or more compressed
        files of a format and a data structure [
        <a href="/help/data-formats-and-analysis#formats">
          more about data formats and strcutures
        </a>
        ].
      </p>
      <p className="regular text-justify">
        In the search results, daseen typically always refers to the data source
        from which the asset referenced in the EDP can be loaded. An exception
        is the assets where the meta information provided by the data source
        only contains a direct download link. For such assets, the EDP refers to
        the direct download link of the asset.
      </p>
      <h5 className="mt-4">Free text search (simple)</h5>
      <p className="regular text-justify">

      </ul>
      <h5 className="mt-4">Search in Expert Mode (Query Language)</h5>
      <p className="regular text-justify">
        Expert Mode is an advanced search feature in daseen that enhances your
        search experience by providing autocomplete suggestions for writing
        natural language queries in Elasticsearch. This allows you to create
        complex queries more efficiently and get accurate results based on
        structured search logic.
      </p>
      <p className="regular text-justify">
        By default, Expert Mode is disabled to make it easier to get started
        with daseen. Users with knowledge of the Elasticsearch Query Language
        can activate the mode via the search settings [

      <p>
        While using the standard search, escaping is applied automatically. In
        Expert mode the user needs to ensure proper escaping. The following
        characters must be escaped or avoided if not used intentially as
        operators: &#43; &#45; = && || &#62; &#60; ! &#40; &#41; &#123; &#125;

        In addition to the free text search, daseen also offers a filter-based

        text search. To start a filter-based search, click Filters below the
        search box. All filters are assigned to a filter category. A distinction
        is made between data structure-independent filters ("general filters")
        and data structure-specific filters.
