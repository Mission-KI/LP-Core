        <h3>1. Basic information on data processing and legal basis</h3>
        <p>
          1.1. This data protection declaration informs you about the type,
          scope and purpose of the processing of personal data within our online
          offer and the websites, functions and content connected to it
          (hereinafter jointly referred to as “online offer” or “website”). The
          privacy policy applies regardless of the domains, systems, platforms
          and devices used (e.g. desktop or mobile) on which the online offer is
          executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2. The terminology used, such as e.g. “personal data” or its
          “processing” refer to the definitions in Art. 4 of the General Data
          Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </p>

        <h3>2. Types of data processed/categories of data subjects</h3>
        <p>
          2.1. The personal data of users processed within the framework of this
          online offer include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inventory data (e.g. names and addresses of customers)</li>
          <li>Contact information (e.g., email, phone numbers)</li>
          <li>Communication data</li>
          <li>
            Contractual data (e.g. services used, names of clerks, payment
            information)
          </li>
          <li>
            Usage data (e.g. the web pages visited on our website, interest in
            our products)
          </li>
          <li>
            Meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses)
          </li>
          <li>Content data (e.g. entries in the contact form)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          2.2. The term “user” includes all categories of data subjects. They
          include our business partners, customers, interested parties, and
          other visitors to our online offering. The terms used are to be
          understood as gender-neutral.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.3. We process users’ personal data only in compliance with the
          relevant data protection provisions. This means that user data will
          only be processed with legal permission, in particular if the data
          processing is necessary for the provision of our contractual services
          (e.g. processing of orders) and online services, or is required by
          law, or if the user has given his consent, as well as on the basis of
          our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization
          and economic operation and security of our online offer in the sense
          of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO, in particular when measuring reach,
          creating profiles for advertising and marketing purposes, and
          collecting access data and using third-party services.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.4. We point out that the legal basis of the consents is Art. 6 para.
          1 lit. a. and Art. 7 DSGVO, the legal basis for processing for the
          fulfillment of our services and implementation of contractual measures
          Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b. DSGVO, the legal basis for processing to
          fulfill our legal obligations Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c. DSGVO, and the
          legal basis for processing to protect our legitimate interests Art. 6
          para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO is.
        </p>

        <p>2.5. The following persons are affected by the data processing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Contract and business partners</li>
          <li>Users of our online offering</li>
          <li>
            Interested parties who are interested in our online offer or contact
            us for other reasons
          </li>
          <li>Customers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Security measures</h3>
        <p>
          We take appropriate organizational, contractual, and technical
          security measures in the sense of Art. 32 DSGVO according to the state
          of the art, taking into account the implementation costs and the
          nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of the data processing, as
          well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights
          and freedoms, in order to ensure an adequate level of protection for
          your data. We hereby ensure compliance with the provisions of data
          protection laws and protect this data against accidental or
          intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or against access by
          unauthorized persons.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.1. The security measures include, in particular, the encrypted
          transmission of data between your browser and our server. You can
          recognize such encrypted connections by the fact that the URL in the
          address bar of your browser starts with “https://”. This is a
          communication protocol with which data can be transmitted in a
          tap-proof manner as part of transport encryption.
        </p>

        <h3>
          4. Disclosure of data to third parties and third-party providers
        </h3>
        <p>
          4.1. Data is only passed on to third parties within the framework of
          legal requirements. We only pass on the user’s data to third parties
          if this is necessary, for example, on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
          b DSGVO for contractual purposes or on the basis of legitimate
          interests according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO in the economic and
          effective operation of our business.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2. We only use subcontractors to provide our services if we have
          taken suitable legal precautions and appropriate technical and
          organizational measures to ensure the protection of the personal data
          processed in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3. Insofar as content, tools, or other means described within the
          scope of this data protection declaration are used by other providers
          (hereinafter collectively referred to as “third-party providers”), we
          comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude
          corresponding contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data
          with the recipients of your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.4. If we use a third-party provider whose registered office is
          located in a third country (outside the European Union (EU) or the
          European Economic Area), it must be assumed that data is transferred
          to the countries in which the third-party provider is based. The
          transfer of data to third countries only takes place if there is an
          adequate level of data protection, user consent, or otherwise legal
          permission.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Provision of contractual services</h3>
        <p>
          5.1. We process inventory data (e.g. names and addresses as well as
          contact data of users), contract data (e.g. services used, names of
          contact persons, payment information) for the purpose of fulfilling
          our contractual obligations and services in accordance with the German
          Data Protection Act, Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b DSGVO. We inform the
          contractual partners which data are required for the aforementioned
          purposes before or in the course of data collection, e.g. in online
          forms, by means of special marking (e.g. colors) or symbols (e.g.
          asterisks or similar), or in person. Within the scope of applicable
          law, we only disclose this data to third parties to the extent that
          this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or to fulfill legal
          obligations or with your consent (e.g. to participating
          telecommunications, transport, and other auxiliary services as well as
          subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service
          providers or tax authorities).
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2. We delete the data after the expiry of legal warranty and
          comparable obligations, i.e., generally after 4 years, unless the data
          is stored in a customer account, e.g., as long as it must be retained
          for legal archiving reasons (e.g., for tax purposes generally 10
          years). We delete data disclosed to us by the contractual partner
          within the scope of a contractual relationship in accordance with the
          specifications of the contract, generally after fulfillment of the
          contractual services.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Contact</h3>
        <p>
          6.1. When contacting us (via contact form or e-mail), the information
          provided by the user will be used for processing the contact request
          and its handling in accordance with Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Here,
          we only process the data that we need to process your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2. User information may be stored in our Customer Relationship
          Management System (“CRM System”) or comparable inquiry organization.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Web hosting</h3>
        <p>
          7.1. In order to provide our online offer securely and efficiently, we
          use the services of one or more web hosting providers from whose
          servers (or servers managed by them) the online offer can be accessed.
          For these purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services,
          computing capacity, storage space, and database services, as well as
          security services and technical maintenance services.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2. We collect data on the basis of our legitimate interests within
          the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO about each access to the
          server on which this service is located (so-called server log files).
          The access data includes the name of the website accessed, file, date
          and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of
          successful access, browser type and version, the user’s operating
          system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address, and
          the requesting provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.3. Log file information is stored for security reasons (e.g. for the
          clarification of abuse or fraud) for a maximum of seven days and then
          deleted. Data whose further retention is required for evidentiary
          purposes is exempt from deletion until the final clarification of the
          respective incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          7.4. The web hosting services also include sending, receiving, as well
          as storing e-mails. For these purposes, the addresses of the
          recipients and senders, but also further information on the e-mail
          dispatch (e.g. the providers involved), including the contents of the
          respective e-mails, are processed. Even though our email
          communications have transport path encryption, they are not encrypted
          on the servers from which they are sent and received. The content of
          e-mail communication is therefore fundamentally susceptible to
          manipulation.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Cookies & Reach Measurement</h3>
        <p>
          8.1. When you visit our website, information may be stored on your
          computer in the form of a cookie. Cookies are pieces of information
          that are transmitted from our web server or third-party web servers to
          users’ web browsers, where they are stored for later retrieval. Most
          browsers are set to accept cookies automatically. We would like to
          point out that the use of our online offer without cookies is only
          possible to a limited extent. In particular, the use of your customer
          account is generally not possible, as the use of cookies is
          technically mandatory for this. However, you can also use your browser
          to prevent only certain cookies from being set (e.g. cookies from
          third-party providers), for example if you want to prevent web
          tracking. For more information, see the help function of your browser.
          For more information about third-party cookies that are set or
          processed when you visit our website, please see the privacy policy
          below, if we make use of them. The term cookies also includes other
          technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g., when
          user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also
          known as “user IDs”).
        </p>
        <p>
          A distinction must be made between cookies that are set by the website
          operator when you visit a website (also known as “first-party
          cookies”) and cookies that are set by third-party providers (also
          known as “third-party cookies”). We only have technical control over
          the former cookies. We further differentiate between the following
          cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temporary cookies (also: session cookies): Temporary cookies are
          deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed
          his browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Permanent cookies: Permanent cookies remain stored even after the
          browser is closed. For example, login status can be saved or preferred
          content can be displayed directly when the user revisits a website.
          Likewise, the interests of users used for reach measurement or
          marketing purposes may be stored in such a cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies: Cookies
          may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to
          store logins or other user inputs or for security reasons).
        </p>
        <p>
          Statistics, marketing and personalization cookies: Furthermore,
          cookies are generally also used in the context of range measurement
          and when a user’s interests or behavior (e.g. viewing certain content,
          using functions, etc.) on individual websites are stored in a user
          profile. Such profiles serve e.g. to show users content that matches
          their potential interests. This process is also called “tracking”,
          i.e., following the potential interests of users. We will inform you
          separately about the use of “tracking” technologies in our privacy
          policy or in the context of obtaining consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2. We use “session cookies”, which are only stored for the duration
          of the current visit to our online presence (e.g. to enable the
          storage of your login status or the shopping cart function and thus
          the use of our online offer at all). In a session cookie, a randomly
          generated unique identification number is stored, a so-called session
          ID. In addition, a cookie contains information about its origin and
          the storage period. These cookies cannot store any other data. Session
          cookies are deleted when you have finished using our online offer and
          have logged in, for example, log out or close the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.3. If users do not want cookies to be stored on their computer, they
          are asked to disable the corresponding option in the system settings
          of their browser. Stored cookies can be deleted in the system settings
          of the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.4. The legal basis on which we process your personal data using
          cookies depends on whether we ask for your consent. If this is the
          case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for the
          processing of your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data
          processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our
          legitimate interests (e.g. in the business operation of our online
          offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to
          fulfill our contractual obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal
          permission, you have the option at any time to revoke any consent
          given or to object to the processing of your data by cookie
          technologies (“opt-out”). You can initially declare your opt-out by
          means of your browser settings by objecting to the setting of cookies
          in the system settings of your browser. An objection to the use of
          cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared by means of
          a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, through the
          websites{" "}
          <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info">

            https://www.youronlinechoices.com/
          </a>
          . In addition, you can receive further instructions on how to object
          within the scope of the information on the service providers and
          cookies used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we process or have data processed within the scope of the use
          of cookies, we ask users for consent that can be revoked at any time.
          Before the consent has not been expressed, cookies are used at most,
          which are necessary for the operation of our online offer. Their use
          is based on our interest and the interest of users in the expected
          functionality of our online offering. This includes usage data (e.g.
          websites visited, interest in content, access times),
          meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses). Users
          of our online offer are affected by this processing. The processing is
          carried out on the legal basis of consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a
          DSGVO) or legitimate interests iSd. Art. 6 par. 1 p. 1 lit. f. GDPR.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Google Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          9.1. We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
          Google Ireland Limited Gordon House, Barrow Street Dublin 4. Ireland
          (“Google”), based on your consent for the analysis, optimization and
          economic operation of our online offer. Google uses permanent
          third-party cookies. The resulting information is processed
          exclusively in our interest.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Facebook Social Plugins</h3>
        <p>
          10.1 We use social plugins (“plugins”) of the social network
          facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand
          Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”),
          based on your consent in the interest of optimizing and economically
          operating our online offer. The plugins can represent interaction
          elements or content (e.g. videos, graphics or text contributions) and
          are recognizable by one of the Facebook logos or are marked with the
          addition “Facebook Social Plugin”.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Facebook Plugins</h3>
        <p>
          10.1. Our online offer uses social plugins ("plugins") from Facebook,
          provided by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025,
          USA. The plugins can be recognized by the Facebook logo or the "Like"
          button. An overview of the Facebook plugins and their appearance can
          be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
        </p>

        <p>
          10.2. When a user calls up a function of this online offer that
          contains such a plugin, a direct connection with Facebook’s servers is
          only established when the user interacts with the plugins. The content
          of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the user’s device
          and integrated by the user into the online offer. In doing so, usage
          profiles of the users can be created from the processed data. We
          therefore have no influence on the scope of the data that Facebook
          collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform users
          according to our level of knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          10.3. By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information
          that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offer.
          If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to
          his Facebook account. When users interact with the plugins, for
          example by clicking the Like button or posting a comment, the
          corresponding information is transmitted from your device directly to
          Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, it
          is still possible for Facebook to obtain and store his or her IP
          address. According to Facebook, only an anonymized IP address is
          stored in Germany.
        </p>

        <p>
          10.4. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further
          processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the related
          rights and settings options for protecting the privacy of users, can
          be found in the privacy policy of Facebook:{" "}
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">
            https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          10.5. If a user is a Facebook member and does not want Facebook to
          collect data about him or her via this online offering and link it to
          his or her membership data stored with Facebook, he or she must log
          out of Facebook and delete his or her cookies before using our online
          offering. Further settings and objections to the use of data for
          advertising purposes are possible within the Facebook profile
          settings:{" "}
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">
            https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads

            http://www.youronlinechoices.com/

          devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Reach Analysis with Matomo</h3>
        <p>
          11.1. Based on your consent, we use Matomo, an open source software
          for statistical evaluation of user access, for the analysis,
          optimization and economic operation of our online offer. The IP
          address of the users is shortened before it is stored. However, Matomo
          uses first party cookies, which are stored on the user’s computer and
          which enable an analysis of the use of this online offer by the user.
          In doing so, pseudonymous usage profiles of the users can be created
          from the processed data.
        </p>

        <p>
          11.2. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this
          online offer is stored on our server and not passed on to third
          parties.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Newsletter</h3>
        <p>
          12.1. The following information explains the contents of our
          newsletter as well as the registration, dispatch and statistical
          evaluation procedures and your rights of objection. By subscribing to
          our newsletter, you agree to receive it and to the procedures
          described.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.2. We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications
          with promotional information (hereinafter “newsletter”) only with the
          consent of the recipients or a legal permission. Insofar as the
          contents of the newsletter are specifically described in the course of
          registration, they are decisive for the user’s consent. In addition,
          our newsletters contain information about our products, offers,
          promotions and our company.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.3. The registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called
          double opt-in process. I.e. after registration you will receive an
          email asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is
          necessary so that no one can log in with foreign e-mail addresses.
          Subscriptions to the newsletter are logged in order to be able to
          prove the subscription process in accordance with legal requirements.
          This includes the storage of the login and confirmation time, as well
          as the IP address. Likewise, changes to your data stored with the
          shipping service provider are logged.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.4. The newsletter is sent by means of CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG,
          Mühlenstr. 43, 26180 Rastede, hereinafter referred to as “Shipping
          Service Provider”. You can view the privacy policy of the shipping
          service provider here:{" "}
          <a href="https://www.cleverreach.com/de/datenschutz/">
            https://www.cleverreach.com/de/datenschutz/
          </a>
          .
        </p>

        <p>
          12.5. The newsletter is sent using “MailChimp”, a newsletter sending
          platform of the US provider Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De
          Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA. You can view the privacy
          policy of the shipping service provider here:{" "}
          <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">
            https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/
          </a>
          . So-called standard contractual clauses have been agreed to ensure an
          appropriate level of data protection.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.6. Furthermore, according to its own information, the shipping
          service provider may use this data in pseudonymous form, i.e. without
          assigning it to a user, to optimize or improve its own services, for
          example for the technical optimization of the dispatch and the
          presentation of the newsletters or for statistical purposes to
          determine from which countries the recipients come. However, the
          dispatch service provider does not use the data of our newsletter
          recipients to write to them itself or to pass them on to third
          parties.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.7. Registration data: To register for the newsletter, it is
          sufficient to provide your e-mail address. Optionally, we ask you to
          enter a name for the purpose of personal address in the newsletter.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.8. The newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”, i.e. a
          pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server of the dispatch
          service provider when the newsletter is opened. Within the scope of
          this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the
          browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of
          the retrieval are initially collected. This information is used for
          the technical improvement of the services based on the technical data
          or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their
          retrieval locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP
          address) or the access times. Statistical surveys also include
          determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and
          which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can
          be assigned to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is
          neither our intention nor that of the shipping service provider to
          monitor individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to
          recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to
          them or to send different content according to the interests of our
          users.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.9. The use of the shipping service provider, the performance of
          statistical surveys and analyses, as well as logging of the
          registration process, are carried out on the basis of our legitimate
          interests in accordance with the German Data Protection Act. Art. 6
          par. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our interest is directed towards the use of a
          user-friendly as well as secure newsletter system that serves our
          business interests as well as meets the expectations of the users.
        </p>

        <p>
          12.10. You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e.
          revoke your consents. At the same time, your consent to its dispatch
          by the dispatch service provider and the statistical analyses will
          expire. A separate revocation of the dispatch by the dispatch service
          provider or the statistical evaluation is unfortunately not possible.
          You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each
          newsletter. If users have only subscribed to the newsletter and
          cancelled this subscription, their personal data will be deleted.
        </p>
        <h3>13. Integration of Videos</h3>
        <p>
          13.1 We use videos to display the submitted contributions. Since local
          hosting of videos is not powerful enough, we rely on external video
          providers. We use the services of Vimeo, Inc., West 18th Street, New
          York 10011, USA (“Vimeo”).
        </p>
        <p>
          13.2 The integration of the videos results in a call to the provider’s
          servers. For the associated use of data, we refer to the respective
          data protection information of the provider. Vimeo’s privacy policy is
          available at the following link:{" "}
          <a href="https://vimeo.com/privacy">https://vimeo.com/privacy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.3 The legal basis for the integration of the videos and the
          associated transmission of personal data is for registered users of
          our offer Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. The integration is necessary
          because there is currently no comparable video solution available to
          provide protected videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.4 For non-registered users, the legal basis for the transmission of
          personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.5 To ensure an appropriate level of data protection when
          transferring data to the USA, we have concluded the so-called standard
          contractual clauses with the provider of Vimeo. As a further
          protective measure, we always include videos in the “Do Not Track”
          variant, so that the amount of personal data transmitted is reduced to
          a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.6 Alternatively, we can also use the service provider YouTube.
          Videos of the platform “YouTube” of the third party provider Google.
          Here, the video is embedded in our website, but still hosted on the
          platform of YouTube. When the video is played, a connection with
          YouTube is established. The privacy policy is available here:{" "}
          <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">
            https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/

        </p>

        <h3>14. Integration of Services and Contents of Third Parties</h3>
        <p>
          14.1 Within our online offer, we use content or service offers of
          third-party providers on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e.,
          interest in the analysis, optimization, and economic operation of our
          online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) or on
          the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO). We use
          content or services offered by third-party providers in order to
          provide their content and services, such as, for example, videos or
          fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “Content”). This is done
          to provide our online offer and to create a user-friendly online
          offer. This always assumes that the third-party providers of this
          content are aware of the IP address of the user, since without the IP
          address they would not be able to send the content to their browser.
          The IP address is thus required for the display of this content. We
          endeavor to use only such content whose respective providers use the
          IP address only for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers
          may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as
          “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags”
          can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the
          pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored
          in third-party cookies on the user’s device and may contain, among
          other things, technical information about the browser and operating
          system, referring websites, time of visit, and other information about
          the use of our online offer, as well as be combined with such
          information from other sources.

            Our online offer uses functions of the network LinkedIn. The
            provider is LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin
            2, Ireland. Each time one of our pages containing LinkedIn functions
            is accessed, a connection to LinkedIn servers is established.

        <h3>15. Rights of the Data Subject</h3>
        <p>
          If your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the
          meaning of the GDPR and you have the following rights vis-à-vis the
          controller:
        </p>

        <p>15.1. Right to Information</p>
        <p>
          You may request confirmation from the controller as to whether
          personal data concerning you is being processed by us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there is such processing, you can request information from the
          controller about the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the purposes for which the personal data are processed;</li>
          <li>the categories of personal data which are processed;</li>
          <li>
            the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data
            concerning you have been or will be disclosed;
          </li>
          <li>
            the planned duration of the storage of the personal data concerning
            you or, if concrete information on this is not possible, criteria
            for determining the storage duration;
          </li>
          <li>
            the existence of a right to rectification or erasure of personal
            data concerning you, a right to restriction of processing by the
            controller or a right to object to such processing;
          </li>
          <li>
            the existence of a right of appeal to a supervisory authority;
          </li>
          <li>
            any available information on the origin of the data, if the personal
            data are not collected from the data subject;
          </li>
          <li>
            the existence of automated decision making including profiling
            pursuant to Art. 22 para. 1 and 4 GDPR and – at least in these cases
            – meaningful information about the logic involved and the scope and
            intended effects of such processing for the data subject.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You have the right to request information on whether personal data
          concerning you is transferred to a third country or to an
          international organization. In this context, you may request to be
          informed about the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 of
          the GDPR in connection with the transfer.
        </p>

        <p>15.2. Right to Rectification</p>
        <p>
          You have a right to rectification and/or completion vis-à-vis the data
          controller, insofar as the personal data processed concerning you are
          inaccurate or incomplete. The responsible party shall make the
          correction without undue delay.
        </p>

        <p>15.3. Right to Restriction of Processing</p>
        <p>
          Under the following conditions, you may request the restriction of the
          processing of personal data concerning you:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            if you contest the accuracy of the personal data concerning you for
            a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the
            personal data;
          </li>
          <li>
            the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of the
            personal data and request instead the restriction of the use of the
            personal data;
          </li>
          <li>
            the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of
            processing, but you need them for the assertion, exercise or defense
            of legal claims; or
          </li>
          <li>
            if you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO
            and it has not yet been determined whether the legitimate reasons of
            the controller outweigh your reasons.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Where the processing of personal data concerning you has been
          restricted, such data may be processed, with the exception of their
          storage, only with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or
          defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another
          natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of
          the Union or a Member State.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the restriction of processing has been restricted in accordance
          with the above conditions, you will be informed by the controller
          before the restriction is lifted.
        </p>

        <p>15.4. Right to Deletion</p>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Obligation to Delete</strong>
          <br />
          You may request the controller to delete the personal data concerning
          you without undue delay, and the controller is obliged to delete such
          data without undue delay, if one of the following reasons applies:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The personal data concerning you are no longer necessary for the
            purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
          </li>
          <li>
            You revoke your consent on which the processing is based according
            to Art. 6 par. 1 lit. a or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR and there is
            no other legal basis for the processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            They lay out acc. Art. 21 par. 1 DSGVO and there are no overriding
            legitimate grounds for the processing, or you lodge an objection to
            the processing pursuant to Art. Art. 21 par. 2 DSGVO to object to
            the processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            The personal data concerning you have been processed unlawfully.
          </li>
          <li>
            The deletion of the personal data concerning you is necessary for
            compliance with a legal obligation under Union or Member State law
            to which the controller is subject.
          </li>
          <li>
            The personal data concerning you has been processed in relation to
            information society services offered pursuant to Art. 8 para. 1
            DSGVO collected.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Information to Third Parties</strong>
          <br />
          If the controller has made the personal data concerning you public and
          is responsible pursuant to Art. 17 par. 1 DSGVO to erase them, it
          shall take reasonable measures, including technical measures, having
          regard to the available technology and the cost of implementation, to
          inform data controllers processing the personal data that you, as data
          subject, have requested erasure of all links to or copies or
          replications of such personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) Exceptions</strong>
          <br />
          The right to erasure does not exist insofar as the processing is
          necessary to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            to exercise the right to freedom of expression and information;
          </li>
          <li>
            for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing
            under Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject,
            or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest
            or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
          </li>
          <li>
            for reasons of public interest in the field of public health
            pursuant to Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h and i and Art. 9 para. 3 GDPR;
          </li>
          <li>
            for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
            historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes in
            accordance with Art. 89 par. 1 GDPR, insofar as the right referred
            to in Section a) is likely to render impossible or seriously
            prejudice the achievement of the purposes of such processing; or
          </li>
          <li>for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>15.5. Right to Information</p>
        <p>
          If you have asserted the right to rectification, erasure or
          restriction of processing against the controller, the controller is
          obliged to notify all recipients to whom the personal data concerning
          you have been disclosed of this rectification or erasure of the data
          or restriction of processing, unless this proves impossible or
          involves a disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed
          about these recipients by the data controller.
        </p>

        <p>15.6. Right to Data Portability</p>
        <p>
          You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you that
          you have provided to the controller in a structured, common and
          machine-readable format. In addition, you have the right to transmit
          this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller
          to whom the personal data was provided, provided that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 par. 1 lit. a
            DSGVO or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO or on a contract pursuant to
            Art. 6 par. 1 lit. b DSGVO; and
          </li>
          <li>
            the processing is carried out with the help of automated procedures.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In exercising this right, you also have the right to obtain that the
          personal data concerning you be transferred directly from one
          controller to another controller, insofar as this is technically
          feasible. Freedoms and rights of other persons must not be affected by
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The right to data portability does not apply to processing of personal
          data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
          controller.
        </p>

        <p>15.7. Right of Objection</p>
        <p>
          You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your
          particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning
          you which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f
          DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The controller shall no longer process the personal data concerning
          you unless it can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
          processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or for
          the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the personal data concerning you is processed for the purpose of
          direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the
          processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such
          marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to
          such direct marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, the
          personal data concerning you will no longer be processed for these
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the possibility, in connection with the use of information
          society services – notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC – to exercise
          your right to object by means of automated procedures using technical
          specifications.
        </p>

        <p>
          15.8. Right to Revoke the Declaration of Consent Under Data Protection
          Law
        </p>
        <p>
          You have the right to revoke your data protection consent at any time.
          The revocation of consent does not affect the legality of the
          processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the
          revocation.
        </p>

        <p>15.9. Automated decision in individual cases including profiling</p>
        <p>
          You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on
          automated processing – including profiling – which produces legal
          effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This
          does not apply if the decision:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            is necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract between
            you and the responsible party,
          </li>
          <li>
            is permitted by legislation of the Union or the Member States to
            which the controller is subject and that legislation contains
            appropriate measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and your
            legitimate interests, or
          </li>
          <li>is done with your express consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, these decisions may not be based on special categories of
          personal data pursuant to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO, unless Art. 9 para. 2
          lit. a or g applies and appropriate measures have been taken to
          protect the rights and freedoms and your legitimate interests.
        </p>
        <p>
          With regard to the cases referred to in (1) and (3), the controller
          shall take reasonable steps to safeguard the rights and freedoms of,
          and the legitimate interests of, the data subject, which shall
          include, at least, the right to obtain the intervention of a person on
          the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to
          contest the decision.
        </p>


        <p>
          The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall
          inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint,
          including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR.
        </p>

        <p>15.10. Right to complain to a supervisory authority</p>
        <p>
          Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you
          have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in
          particular in the Member State of your residence, workplace or the
          place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing
          of personal data concerning you infringes the GDPR.
        </p>
        <p>
          The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been lodged shall
          inform the complainant of the status and outcome of the complaint,
          including the possibility of a judicial remedy under Article 78 GDPR.
        </p>

        <h3>16. Deletion of Data</h3>
        <p>
          16.1. The data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no
          longer required for their intended purpose and the deletion does not
          conflict with any statutory retention obligations. Deletion shall also
          take place, in particular, if other permissible circumstances cease to
          apply. If the users’ data is not deleted because it is required for
          other and legally permissible purposes, its processing is restricted,
          i.e. the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This
          applies e.g. for user data that must be retained for reasons of
          commercial or tax law.
        </p>
        <p>
          16.2. According to legal requirements, the storage takes place for 6
          years in accordance with § 257 para. 1 HGB (commercial books,
          inventories, opening balances, annual financial statements, commercial
          letters, accounting vouchers, etc.) and for 10 years in accordance
          with § 147 para. 1 AO (books, records, management reports, accounting
          vouchers, commercial and business letters, documents relevant for
          taxation, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>17. Right of Objection</h3>
        <p>
          Users may object to the future processing of their personal data in
          accordance with the legal requirements at any time. The objection can
          be made in particular against the processing for purposes of direct
          advertising.
        </p>

        <h3>18. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
          18.1. We reserve the right to change the privacy policy in order to
          adapt it to changed legal situations, or in the event of changes to
          the service as well as data processing. However, this only applies
          with regard to declarations on data processing. Insofar as user
          consents are required or components of the data protection declaration
          contain provisions of the contractual relationship with the users, the
          changes shall only be made with the consent of the users.
        </p>
        <p>
          18.2. Users are requested to inform themselves regularly about the
          content of the privacy policy.
