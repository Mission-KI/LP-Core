            Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for the Use of the daseen Search Engine
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginTop: '40px'}}>
          <strong>Scope:</strong> These Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") govern the
          general terms and conditions for the use of the digital daseen
          application, whose functionalities are made available for access via a
          web browser (hereinafter referred to as "daseen").
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Search Engine:</strong> daseen is provided to you as a user
          free of charge (loan of a digital tool via remote access) and includes
          the functionality to locate connected datasets according to their
          profiles. Specific results are not owed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Search Results and Intellectual Property:</strong> You agree
          to respect copyrights and other intellectual property rights.
          Retrieved search results, data, and data profiles may only be used for
          your own purposes. They are subject to the Creative Commons License
          CC-BY-NC-ND (Attribution, Non-Commercial, No Derivatives).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>daseen Usage Right:</strong> For the use of the search engine
          itself, you are granted a simple, non-transferable right,
          geographically limited to the EU and EFTA, to use the functionalities
          of daseen via remote internet access for the duration of your
          research. Access to and/or provision of a physical or digital copy of
          daseen is not included.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>daseen Usage Duration:</strong> You may use daseen for the
          duration of your respective research. We reserve the right to revoke
          the right of use under these AUP at any time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Prohibition of Data Mining:</strong> Data mining (as defined
          in Section 44b of the German Copyright Act) of our website, daseen,
          and search results or data profiles obtained through it, or other
          retrievable information is not permitted and is otherwise only allowed
          within the scope of legal permissions and in compliance with our AUP.
          We reserve the right to take technical measures to prevent data
          mining.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Excluded Usage:</strong> Automated mass queries as well as
          excessive requests and unusual system load are not permitted. We
          reserve all uses. Extracting substantial parts of the data profiles
          violates our database maker's right according to Section 87a et seq.
          of the German Copyright Act.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Prohibition of Manipulation:</strong> Any manipulation of
          daseen, data profiles, search results, including cloaking (presenting
          false content to daseen) or keyword stuffing (excessive use of
          keywords or manipulation), is prohibited.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Warranty:</strong> Section 599 of the German Civil Code
          applies. There is no claim to completeness, correctness, or
          correctness of the search results unless fraudulently concealed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Liability for simple
          negligent breaches of duty is excluded, unless these concern essential
          contractual obligations, damages resulting from injury to life, body
          or health, or guarantees, or affect claims under the Product Liability
          Act. The same applies to breaches of duty by our vicarious agents.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Data Protection:</strong> The processing of personal data is
          carried out in accordance with our privacy policy and applicable data
          protection laws. You commit to responsible handling of other users'
          data.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Transparency:</strong> Sponsored content or advertising will
          be labeled and disclosed as such by us.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Legality:</strong> You agree to comply with all applicable
          laws and regulations in and from the use of daseen.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Changes to the AUP:</strong> We reserve the right to change
          these Terms and Conditions at any time for the future. Users will be
          informed about changes appropriately.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Final Provisions:</strong> German law applies. Should
          individual provisions of these AUP be invalid, the validity of the
          remaining provisions shall remain unaffected.
